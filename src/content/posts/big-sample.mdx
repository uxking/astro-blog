# h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 2 dashes for and em dash or ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Unicode is supported. â˜º


## h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Here's a code sample:

    ### Let me re-iterate ...
    `for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }`

You can also do delimited blocks:
Use three backticks \`\`\` and the name the language, such as javascript, bash, python, etc...
>Javascript
```javascript
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```
>Python
```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```



### h3 header 

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this recipe:

        * simmer for 20 min
        * Remove from heat
        * Let cool for 10 min
        * Enjoy

    Add salt and pepper to taste.

Here's a link to [a website](http://example.com) and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].



Tables can look like this:

|size| material    |  color       |
| -- | ----------- |  ----------- | 
| L  |  cotton     |  brown       |
| S  |  cotton-poly blend |  green     |
| XL |   denim     |  blue |
<div class="text-xs">Table Caption</div>

(The above is the caption for the table.) In MDX use `<div class="whatever style you want">Caption</div>` 

You can also do multi-line tables with `<br />`:

|keyword   | text                 |
|--------  | -----------------------|
|red       |Sunsets, apples, and other red <br />or reddish things.                  |
|green     |Leaves, grass, frogs and other <br />things it's not easy being.         |


A horizontal rule with `***`.

***


Images can be specified like so:

`![example image](./images/image-name.png "A datacenter image")`

![example image](./images/big-sample-data-center.png "An datacener image")

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
