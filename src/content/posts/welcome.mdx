# Hello Astro World
This is the first post of the blog.

I have been learning Astro ðŸš€ and decided to build something using the `Content Collections` feature of Astro. 

## Technology used on this blog
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) installed via `npx astro add tailwind`
- Tailwind's typography via `@tailwindcss/typography`
- MDX via `npx astro add mdx`
- Astro Icons via `npx astro add astro-icon`


## Content Collections
I also used Astro's [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#_top) It allows you to setup specific directories where you can store your `.md` or `.mdx` files (content).

### Directory setup
For the blog I used the following folder structure:
```bash
/src/
â””â”€â”€ content/
    â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post1.mdx
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post2.mdx
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ etc.mdx
    â””â”€â”€ images/
        â”œâ”€â”€ image1.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ image2.png
        â””â”€â”€ etc.png

```

There is a bit of setup to map `href`s to the right location since I wanted the main blog path to be /blog/slug, so a lot of ``/blog/${post.slug}`` template literals work to get the links to all work like I wanted them.

**All in all, I think it was a positive experience and really like Astro** Here's to more building...
